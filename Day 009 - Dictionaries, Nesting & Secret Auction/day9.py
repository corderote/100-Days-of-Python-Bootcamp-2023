# Dictionaries & Nesting.

# Dictionaries allow us to group together and tag pieces of information. 
# They give us, in a similar way as a traditional dictionary, a word that we 
# are going call KEY and a description, which  is going to be our VALUE.
# These VALUES do not need to have a type, they can be whatever kind of
# datatype that we want to introduce.
# To write a dictionary, we have, in the form of a table, on the left the KEY, 
# which correspond to the word of a traditional dictionary. And on the right,
# an associated VALUE, that would be the equivalent of the actual definition.

# To write this in python, the syntax would be as follows: 
# A set of curly braces '{}' that delimits the content of our dictionary.
# Whatever we put inside will be the content of our dictionary. 
# To define the content of the dictionary, the KEY goes first on the left side 
# followed by a colon ':' and then we write the VALUE.

key = "Bug"
value = "Error in the program that prevents it to work as intended."

my_dictionary = {key: value}

# If you want to add multiple things to your dictionary, you just need to add 
# a coma ',' at the end of the value and keep writing this key, colon, value 
# structure pairs until you reach the end of your dictionary.

other_dictionary = {
    "key_1": "value 1",
    "key_2": "value 2",
    "key_3": "value 3",
    "key_4": "value 4",
    "key_5": "value 5",
}

# If you want to retrieve a piece of information from a dictionary you have to 
# do in a similar way as with the lists, but in this case, inside the braces 
# you have to insert the key that you want to take the value from. 
# CAREFUL with the typos here. They will create a KEY ERROR MESSAGE.

print(other_dictionary["key_1"])

# Adding new items to the dictionary.
other_dictionary["key_something"] = "value something"
other_dictionary[123] = "value 123" 
# You can work with key or values that are not strictly a string.

print(other_dictionary)

# Creating an empty dictionary or wiping an existing one.
empty_dictionary = {}

# ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- #
# Edit an Item in a dictionary: 
# It works in a similar way than with lists, in the braces '[]' you add the key 
# that you wnt to assign, and then equal all that to the value.
# If it does found an item with the same key already in the dictionary it will
# modify its content, you can not have two items with the same key.
other_dictionary["key_something"] = "New value for something."

# What do you think this will do? 
for thing in other_dictionary:
    print(thing)
# ANSWER: It will print just the key values from the dictionary.

# If ou want to print the values, the proper syntax is as follows:
for key in other_dictionary:
    print(other_dictionary[key])

# Nesting.

# List & dictionaries are this collection types that we can imagine as folders, 
# where lot of things can be stored inside of them.

# another dictionary.
