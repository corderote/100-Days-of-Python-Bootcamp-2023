# To convert to an int datatype we use the int() function.

# Exercise 1 - Data Types
# Write a program that adds the digits in a two digits number.
# e.g. if the input was 35, then the output should be 3 + 5 = 8
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
two_digit_number = input("Type a two digit number: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Exercise 2 - BMI Calculator.
# Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's 
# weight and height.
# The BMI is a measure of someone's weight taking into account their height.
# e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, 
#      the short person is usually more overweight.
# The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square 
# of their height (in m)

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
height = input("enter your height in m: ")
weight = input("enter your weight in kg: ")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡
bmi = float(weight)/float(height)**2
print(bmi)
print(int(bmi))

# Number manipulation and F-strings
# The round() function allows us to round a decimal value.
# We can use a second input value to specify a precision of such decimal 
# digits.

tmp_value *= 4  # value = value * 4

# f-string:
# By using f before the brackets you can convert a string into f-string
# This allows us to handle other datatypes easier inside the strings. 
print(f"Your current value is {tmp_value}")

# Exercise 3 - Life in Weeks
# Create a program using maths and f-Strings that tells us how many days, 
# weeks, months we have left if we live until 90 years old.
# It will take your current age as the input and output a message with our 
# time left in this format: You have x days, y weeks, and z months left.
# Where x, y and z are replaced with the actual calculated numbers.

# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code below ðŸ‘‡
age = input("What is your current age?")
# ðŸš¨ Don't change the code above ðŸ‘†

# Write your code below this line ðŸ‘‡

# DAY 2 Project. Tip Calculator.

# Create a greeting for the program.

# Collect all the data required from the user and set their datatypes.

# Calculate the price with the tip and the price that each person has to pay.
bill_with_tip = round(total_bill * (1+(tip_percentage/100)), 2)
price_per_person = round(bill_with_tip / people, 2)
# Here we use format nomenclature to make sure it always displays 2 decimal 
# digits.
